myrandom.js
============

myrandom.js implements reddit's paywalled myrandom button for everyone. I tried to get this built into the open source [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/), but honestbleeps seems complacent with forcing an inferior experience onto his users, against the principles of open source.
